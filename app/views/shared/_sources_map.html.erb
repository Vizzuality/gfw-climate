          <p>Development of agriculture and other human activities on tropical peatlands requires drainage, which leads to increased CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from peat decomposition. Highly productive croplands, including plantations, will always be 100 percent drained (Hooijer et al. 2010). IPCC Tier 1 methods were applied to estimate annual CO2 emissions from peat drainage in Indonesia and Malaysia within plantation areas only, based on the area of overlap between mapped areas of plantations in 2013-14 (Transparent World 2015) and mapped areas of peatlands (Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture, 2011 for Indonesia; Wetlands International, 2004 for Malaysia). Emission factors for oil palm, Acacia, and other species were 40, 73, and 55 t CO2 ha-1 yr-1, respectively, based on guidance provided in Equation 2.3 and Table 2.1 of IPCC Wetlands Supplement (2014). The value of 55 t CO2 ha-1 yr-1 represents the average of emission factor estimates for oil palm and acacia plantations.</p>

            <dd>As forest patches are often considerably smaller than 25 ha (the area of one pixel on the map), one limitation of this data set is that mean pixel age may reflect a mixture of different forest ages and land cover types within each pixel. This spatial mixing may result in over-representation of mid-age values and an overestimation of the areal extent of secondary forests. Techniques for mapping the age and extent of secondary forests at pixel sizes below 25 ha are needed to provide more spatially accurate assessments of SF extent and carbon sequestration potential at the country and regional levels. Incorporating new data like the higher resolution biomass map available on GFW Climate can potentially improve the precision of estimates shown here. Mapped carbon sequestration potential is likely an underestimate of the actual potential, for several reasons. Belowground carbon stocks in soils and roots will add 25% or more to total carbon storage, but knowledge regarding determinants of successional dynamics of belowground carbon sequestration is insufficient to include in projections. The data set excludes montane areas of Latin America, where secondary forests are regenerating spontaneously on abandoned farmland. Estimates of carbon sequestration potential assume that second-growth forest areas remain intact over the time frames indicated. Deforestation of these forests will reduce their mitigation potential as described in the paper in Science Advances.</dd>

          <p>"This data set, created by a consortium of scientists within the 2ndFOR research network, estimates the carbon sequestration potential of secondary forest regeneration across the tropical lowlands of Latin America. These maps provide spatially explicit guidance and realistic expectations for Latin American countries that are developing their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as part of their United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change commitments. Estimates reflect scenarios where 100% of young secondary forests (YSF, 1 to 20 years), mid-secondary forests (MSF, 20 to 60 years), pasture areas, and crop areas are allowed to regenerate for 12, 22, and 40 years at rates predicted by post-abandonment chronosequence studies. Estimates do not assume any tree planting or assisted regeneration practices beyond creating conditions that permit natural regeneration, such as fencing or fire protection. Projections are derived using an extensive data set on biomass recovery during forest succession and a map of estimated aboveground biomass (AGB) circa the year 2008 produced by Woods Hole Research Center. The biomass map used in this work is a precursor to the higher resolution version now available on GFW Climate; both are based on a large network of field plots coupled with satellite LiDAR (light detection and ranging) to parameterize wall-to-wall MODIS or Landsat satellite data at a spatial resolution of 500 m or 30 m, respectively. Biomass accumulation over 12, 32, and 40 years into the future was projected using an equation relating forest age to biomass.

          <p>Soil is the second largest global carbon stock (after oceans) and is a significant component of the biosphere, delivering important ecosystem services. Soil organic carbon is a major component of soil organic matter, which is derived from residual, decomposed plant and animal material. Natural factors, such as land cover, vegetation, topography and climate, as well as man-made factors, such as land use and management, can influence the amount of soil organic matter, and thus soil organic carbon, present in soils.</p>
          <p>To calculate topsoil organic carbon, we use data from the <a href="http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HTML/index.html?sb=1" target="_blank">Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD)</a>, a compilation of four soil databases: the European Soil Database (ESDB), the 1:1 million soil map of China, various regional SOTER databases (SOTWIS Database), and the Soil Map of the World. The HWSD contains information on soil parameters, such as organic carbon, pH, water storage capacity, soil depth, total exchangeable nutrients and salinity.</p>
          <p>Topsoil organic carbon (measured in tons per hectare) was calculated using inputs of percent carbon content, bulk density, and gravel volume. We use relative bulk density values except for Andosols and Histosols, which are typically overestimated by this method. Values are calculated for 0-30 cm depth.

          <p>This is a higher resolution data product that expands upon the methodology presented in Baccini et al. (2012) to generate a pan-tropical map of aboveground live woody biomass density at 30 m resolution for circa the year 2000. Along with the carbon density values, there is an error map at the same spatial resolution providing the uncertainty in aboveground carbon density estimation. These maps allow for the co-location of biomass estimates with Hansen et al. (2013, v1.0) tree cover loss estimates at similar spatial resolution. The statistical relationship derived between ground-based measurements of forest biomass density and co-located Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) LiDAR waveform metrics as described by Baccini et al. (2012) were used to estimate the biomass density of more than 40,000 GLAS footprints throughout the tropics. Then, using randomForest models, the GLAS-derived estimates of biomass density were correlated to continuous, gridded variables including Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery and products (e.g., reflectance), elevation, and biophysical variables. By using continuous gridded datasets as inputs to the randomForest models, a wall-to-wall 30 m resolution map of aboveground woody biomass density across the tropics was produced as well as the associated uncertainty layer. The uncertainty layer takes into account the errors from allometric equations, LiDAR based model, and randomForest model. All the errors are propagated to the final biomass estimate. A detailed description of the work will be reported in a new paper under preparation.</p>

          <p> “Managed forests” refers to areas allocated by a government for harvesting timber and other wood products in a public forest. Managed forests are distinct from wood fiber concessions, where tree plantations are established for the exclusive production of pulp and paper products. “Concession” is used as a general term for licenses, permits, or other contracts that confer rights to private companies to manage and extract timber and other wood products from public forests; terminology varies at the national level, however, and includes "forest permits," "tenures," "licenses," and other terms.</p>

          <p>This data set displays managed forest concessions as a single layer assembled by aggregating data for multiple countries.

          <p>“Mining concession” refers to an area allocated by a government or other body for the extraction of minerals. The terminology for these areas varies from country to country. “Concession” is used as a general term for licenses, permits, or other contracts that confer rights to private companies to manage and extract minerals from public lands; terminology varies at the national level, however, and includes mineral or mining "permits," "tenures," "licenses," and other terms.</p>

          <p>This data set displays mining concessions as a single layer assembled by aggregating concession data for multiple countries. The data may come from government agencies, NGOs, or other organizations and varies by date and data sources.

Indicators of ecosystem health are grouped into the categories of river fragmentation, biodiversity, and water quality. The database was created and published by International Rivers in 2014.</p>
          <p>The Dam Hotspots data contains over 5,000 dam locations determined by latitude and longitude coordinates. These locations were confined to the world’s 50 major river basins. The data set comes from multiple sources, and was corrected for location errors by International Rivers. The “project status”—a moving target—was determined by acquiring official government data, as well as through primary research from Berkeley and five International Rivers’ regional offices.</p>

            <dd>The world IFL map was created through visual interpretation of Landsat images by experts. The map may contain inaccuracies due to limitations in the spatial resolution of the imagery and lack of ancillary information about local land-use practices in some regions. In addition, the methodology assumes that fires in proximity to roads or other infrastructure may have been caused by humans, and therefore constitute a form of anthropogenic disturbance. This assumption could result in an underestimation of IFL extent in the boreal biome.</dd>

          <p>The <a href='http://intactforests.org/' target='_blank'>Intact Forest Landscapes</a> (IFL) data set identifies unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems within the zone of forest extent that show no signs of significant human activity and are large enough that all native biodiversity, including viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be maintained. To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable, the latter to allow for repeated assessments over time as well as verification. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. These were then mapped from Landsat imagery for the years 2000 and 2013.</p>

          <p>Changes in the extent of IFLs were identified within year 2000 IFL boundary using the global wall-to-wall Landsat image composite for year 2013 and the global forest cover loss dataset (Hansen et al., 2013). Areas identified as “reduction in extent” met the IFL criteria in 2000, but no longer met the criteria in 2013. The main causes of change were clearing for agriculture and tree plantations, industrial activity such as logging and mining, fragmentation due to infrastructure and new roads, and fires assumed to be caused by humans.</p>

          <p>This data can be used to assess forest intactness, alteration, and degradation at global and regional scales. More information about the data set and methodology is available on  <a href="http://www.intactforests.org">www.intactforests.org</a></p>

            An accuracy assessment found 40% false positives and 18% false negatives for the presence of plantations, with an overall accuracy of 79%. Overall accuracies were lowest in Indonesia at 68%.
            The accuracies of the species and type labels were not assessed. These fields represent the best guess of the analysts and should not be used for official purposes.
            Polygons labeled as clearings were bare or had very young vegetation as of 2013 or 2014, but contextual clues suggest that these areas will eventually become tree plantations.

          <p>This data set was created by Transparent World, with the support of Global Forest Watch. Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru.</p>

          <p>Given the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">Landsat</a>, supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.</p>

          <p>Each polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A “gr” in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within apolygon (as in the case of a mosaic). Types are defined as follows:</p>
          <p><ul class="bullets">
            <li><strong>Large industrial plantation:</strong> single plantation units larger than 100 hectares</li>
            <li><strong>Mosaic of medium-sized plantations:</strong> mosaic of plantation units < 100 hectares embedded within patches of other land use</li>
            <li><strong>Mosaic of small-sized plantations:</strong> mosaic of plantation units < 10 hectares embedded within patches of other land use.</li>
            <li><strong>Clearing/ very young plantation:</strong> bare ground with contextual clues suggesting it will become a plantations (shape or pattern of clearing, proximity to other plantations, distinctive road network, etc)</li>
          </ul></p>
          <p>For more information on this data set and how it was produced, see the forthcoming WRI Technical Note associated with this project.</p>

          <p>This data set shows the coverage of primary humid tropical forest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the year 2000 at a 60 meter resolution. “Primary forest” is defined in this data set as mature humid tropical forest with greater than 60% canopy cover, and differs from “secondary forest” (regrowing forest with greater than 60% canopy cover) and “woodlands” (between 30% and 60% canopy cover). The authors created a composite of cloud-free Landsat imagery during the growing season of 2000 to conduct the analysis. They applied supervised bagged classification tree models to separate forest areas from non-forest based on training sites. Within forest areas, primary forests were separated from secondary forests and woodlands using supervised classification.

          <p>The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most comprehensive global spatial data set on marine and terrestrial protected areas available. Protected area data are provided via <a href='http://www.protectedplanet.net/' target='_blank'>protectedplanet.net</a>, the online interface for the <a href='http://www.wdpa.org/' target='_blank'>World Database on Protected Areas</a> (WDPA). The WDPA is a joint initiative of the IUCN and UNEP-WCMC to compile spatially referenced information about protected areas.</p>

          <p><strong><a href='http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/' target='_blank'>IUCN Management Categories</a></strong></p>

          <p>Not all protected areas receive the same degree of protection. While some have strict guidelines designed to preserve intact ecosystems, others allow for sustainable land use, often including limited resource extraction. In addition, not all countries use the same terminology when designating a protected area. Accordingly, the  <a href='http://www.iucn.org/' target='_blank'>International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> defined universal management categories that stipulate the level of protection for most protected areas.</p>

          <p>As you click through protected areas in this layer, note the “legal designation” and the explanations below to better understand the degree to which an area is protected.</p>

          <ul class='bullets'>
            <li><strong>Ia. Strict Nature Reserves.</strong> Protected areas designed to preserve biodiversity and all geological features. Limited human use (e.g., scientific study, education) is allowed and carefully monitored. Strict Nature Reserves are often used to understand the impact of indirect human disturbance (e.g., burning fossil fuels) because of the area’s high level of preservation. <em>Other common designations:</em> Biological Reserve, Botanical Reserve</li>
            <li><strong>Ib. Wilderness Areas.</strong> Protected areas managed to preserve ecosystem processes with limited human use. Wilderness Areas cannot contain modern infrastructure (e.g., a visitor’s center), but they allow for local indigenous groups to maintain subsistence lifestyles. These areas are often established to restore disturbed environments. <em>Other common designations:</em> Wilderness Reserve, Wildlife Area</li>
            <li><strong>II. National Parks.</strong> Protected areas designed to preserve large-scale ecosystems and support human visitation. With conservation as a priority, these areas allow infrastructure and contribute to the local economy by providing opportunities for environmental educational and recreation. <em>Other common designations:</em> State Park, Class A Park, Park Reserve, Provincial Park</li>
            <li><strong>III. National Monuments or Features.</strong> Areas established to protect a specific natural feature (e.g., cave, grove) or human-made monument with significant historical, spiritual, or environmental importance and the immediate surroundings. Accordingly, Natural Monuments or Features are typically smaller in area and have high human impact resulting from visitor traffic. <em>Other common designations:</em> Natural Features Reserve, Nature Monument, Botanical Garden</li>
            <li><strong>IV. Habitat and Species Management Areas.</strong> Areas designed to conserve specific wildlife populations and/or habitats. Habitat and Species Management Areas often exist within a larger ecosystem or protected area and are carefully managed (e.g., through hunting abatement or habitat restoration) to conserve a target species or habitat. <em>Other common designations:</em> National Wildlife Refuge, State Wildlife Management Area, Faunal Reserve, Zakaznik (Russia), Provincial Reserve, Wildlife Sanctuary</li>
            <li><strong>V. Protected Landscapes and Seascapes.</strong> Protected areas with ecological, biological, or cultural importance that have been shaped by human use of the landscape. Protected landscapes and seascapes typically cover entire bodies of land or ocean and allow for a number of for-profit activities (e.g., ecotourism) in accordance with the region’s management plan. <em>Other common designations:</em> National Forest, State Natural Area, Environmental Protection Area, Protected Area, Quasi National Park (Japan), Nature Reserve, State Natural Area</li>
            <li><strong>VI. Protected Areas with Sustainable Use of Natural Resources.</strong> Areas designed to manage natural resources and uphold the livelihoods of surrounding communities. These regions have a low level of human occupation, small-scale developments (i.e., not industrial), and part of the landscape in its natural condition. <em>Other common designations:</em> Wildlife Reserve, Biosphere Reserve, Forest Reserve, Protective Zone, National Forest, Natural and National Reserves, Reserve, Multiple Use Reserve, Municipal Reserve</li>
          </ul>

          <p class='first'>These base maps show a composite of the best annual Landsat satellite imagery (USGS/NASA) from 1999 to 2012. The annual composites were generated by Google in the Google Earth Engine. The Landsat composites display “Top-of-Atmosphere,” or the most cloud-free, images at 30-meter resolution. More information on Landsat imagery is available from the <a href='http://landsat.usgs.gov/' target='_blank'>Landsat website</a>. Read the terms of service <a href='http://www.google.com/help/terms_maps.html' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Because of the very large file size of the annual Landsat composite layers, images will take some time to reload on the website and as you zoom in and out.</p>

          <p>Drag the handle to adjust the minimum tree cover canopy (TCC) density for Hansen/UMD/Google/USGS/NASA tree cover and tree cover loss displayed in the figures and infographics. TCC density represents the estimated percent of a pixel that was covered by tree canopy in the year 2000, as determined from the analysis of satellite imagery. For the tree cover loss data, TCC density therefore corresponds to the density of tree cover <u>before</u> loss occurred.</p>
          <p>Adjustments to the minimum TCC density will only affect tree cover and tree cover loss. This feature does not pertain to Hansen/UMD/Google/USGS/NASA tree cover gain or to other GFW data layers or country profile statistics. Tree cover gain is displayed with a set minimum TCC density greater than 50%.</p>
          <p>This feature is also available for the Country Rankings and for the map visualization and analysis. The TCC density minimum selected in the Country Data will be applied to the country or subnational jurisdiction analysis and related map visualization if accessed through the Country Data. However, an adjustment to the TCC density minimum through the map settings will not affect the statistics within the Country Data. The Country Rankings will not reflect adjustments made in individual Country Data.</p>
